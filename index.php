		<p>
			Software developer with <strong>9 years</strong> of programming experience, which mainly comprise in <strong>Low-Level Programming, Web Development, Cyber Security and Machine learning</strong>.
			The languages I have the most experience with are <strong>C, Python, Javascript, and C++</strong>.
			My Cyber Security background comes from being the first person in my cyber security class to fully hack into the machines for every lab, and was then added to the <strong>Dalhousie Competitive Hacking Team</strong> where my skills increased further.
			I also have many years working with Dalhousie, from being a Marker, Tutor, and a Teaching Assistant for different computer science classes.
			Now I'm doing my <strong>Masters at Dalhousie University</strong> on a topic involving Cyber Security and Machine Learning.

						Created a testing framework to test the company software automatically, which will save days of work each week for the testers, who were previously testing the software by hand.
					</li>
					<li>
						Presented my testing framework to the company to show how it is used and what are its capabilities.
					</li>
					<li>
						Introduced a feature to their code to be able to return the results of events, a feature which has been proposed to the company for a decade and will open many different capabilities with events which were impossible before.
					</li>
					<li>
						Created a debugging tool to remotely send events to the software, allowing a big time-save when implementing new events within the software.
					</li>
					<li>
						Created a new feature within the software to record every event that gets called to a file. This saves a couple a week for developers trying to figure out which event is being called, as well as giving testers the knowledge to create test cases.
